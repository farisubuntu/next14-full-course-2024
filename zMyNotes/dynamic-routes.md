# `Dynamic Routes`

- Dynamic route in `Next.js` refer to a feature that allows you to create web pages with variable or dynamic parts in the `URL`.
- Instead of defining individual routes for every possible `URL`, you can create a single `route pattern` that matches a variety of dynamic values.
- Its useful whe you have pages that share a common structure but differ based on specific information in the `URL`.
